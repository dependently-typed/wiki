# Dragon logo

The logo for `dependently-typed` is a dragon. It was inspired by the venerable [Dragon Book](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811), a very popular book on compilers.

It was designed by [Evonne Pinto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evonnepinto-7a3a341b2/) (who happens to be Elton's sister).
