# Story behind the name

Why is the club named `dependently-typed`?

In the summer of 2021, I (Elton) was fortunate enough to be interning on the PyTorch Dev Infra team at Facebook. It was an eye-opening experience and I enjoyed my time there. Around mid-July, I scheduled some 1-on-1 time with [Edward Yang](http://ezyang.com/) who works on the PyTorch Composability team. Prior to Facebook, he worked on [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (in particular the [Backpack](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Backpack) module system) and had the amazing opportunity of working with [Sir Simon Peyton Jones](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/simonpj/). Chatting with him inspired me to learn how GHC works.

While browsing through the GHC wiki, I stumbled upon [this paper](https://cs.brynmawr.edu/~rae/papers/2016/thesis/eisenberg-thesis.pdf) by Richard Eisenberg titled _"Dependent Types in Haskell: Theory and Practice"_. In case you are not familiar, dependent types are types which _depend_ on values. You can, for example, define a type that depends on the length of a list (which is variable). This is very heavily used in proof assistants and formal verification languages like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and [F*](https://www.fstar-lang.org/).

In the paper, Eisenberg acknowledges how the [PLClub at Penn](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/) helped him throughout his PhD. After reading this, I thought to myself: "What if I start a PLClub at Georgia Tech?".

In honor of the paper, I decided to name the club `dependently-typed` :)
