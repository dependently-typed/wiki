## New to compilers?

We recommend starting by going through ["Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). The books is available for free online and provides an accessible introduction to the topic.

If you are looking for textbook recommendations, [The Dragon Book](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811) or [Engineering a Compiler](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Compiler-Keith-Cooper/dp/012088478X) will serve you well.

The [langjam](https://github.com/langjam/langjam/blob/main/resources.md) repo also has some good resources on getting started.

## Intermediate?

Read some of this papers listed in [https://c9x.me/compile/bib/](https://c9x.me/compile/bib/)

Highly recommend studying the architecture of existing open source projects. It will help you get better at navigating large codebases and will give you a sense of what techniques the industry is using.

[The Architecture of Open Source Applications](https://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html) has a good list of codebases to study. Let your curiosity guide you through most of this process.

## Interested in theoretical stuff?

[Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) by Benjamin Pierce and [Practical Foundations for Programming Languages](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/index.html) by Robert Harper are great introductory texts. You can find a series of course notes on different kinds of logic on [Frank Pfinning's webpage](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/).

For hands-on experience with formal methods, [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) is great. Once you've graduated from it, you may also want to check out [Certified Programming with Dependent Types](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/) by Adam Chlipala. There is also [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) which is gaining a lot of popularity. It has excellent material on formalizing mathematics using programming languages.
