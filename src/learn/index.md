## New to compilers?

We recommend starting by going through ["Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). The books is available for free online and provides an accessible introduction to the topic.

If you are looking for textbook recommendations, [The Dragon Book](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811) or [Engineering a Compiler](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Compiler-Keith-Cooper/dp/012088478X) will serve you well.

The [langjam](https://github.com/langjam/langjam/blob/main/resources.md) repo also has some good resources on getting started.

## Intermediate?

Read some of this papers listed in [https://c9x.me/compile/bib/](https://c9x.me/compile/bib/)

Highly recommend studying the architecture of existing open source projects. It will help you get better at navigating large codebases and will give you a sense of what techniques the industry is using.

[The Architecture of Open Source Applications](https://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html) has a good list of codebases to study. Let your curiosity guide you through most of this process.
